##Hello and welcome to the very first R9KOSS project!
The objective of this project is to learn c# and improve our coding abilities in a group environment through actual coding experience.

In this project we will be creating a simple game from scratch, which we will then reflect upon to see what we have learned.

To get started, please read the D.O.L. file, and see if you have been assigned any individual tasks.

### Assignment 1
1. At least one class, with at least one method

2. Either a for loop, a while loop, or a do/while loop

3. An if-else statement with at least 2 else if statements

Once you have done this, commit your program to the master with the filename of (Username)-HelloC.cs

You may use any material, online or offline, including my existing file as a reference to learn.

There is no time limit on this assignment, but we will start reviewing each other's code starting today (Tues, Feb. 9) at ~ 5PM EST.

Learn some code, and have fun!

### Assignment 2
Complete any one of [these](https://projecteuler.net/archives). You may complete one of these to fulfill assignment 1 as well.

After you are done, submit as (Username)-(TitleOfProblem).cs
